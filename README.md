# Jets Project

## Description
### Given the recent launch of China's third aircraft carrier (its first indigenous aircraft carrier), I decided to approach this project as though the Chinese government had requested software to enable each airfield to track the aircraft it houses. Having been instructed to create a parent class called Jets (and after much research), I realized that the primary (and unaddressed) category was aircraft, while the secondary category (our parent class for the project) was one type of aircraft engine. There are many ways to distinguish types of aircraft, however, and I subsequently chose to use function as an auxiliary way to distinguish the aircraft in each airfield's fleet. Function here took the form of "combat" or "transport", which had subcategories beneath them. This auxiliary classificaiton was implemented through interfaces.
### The user interface is simple. A user makes numerical selections from a list, and based on their selection, the program performs one of the following functions:
#### 1. List fleet
#### 2. Fly all jets
#### 3. View fastest jet
#### 4. View jet with longest range
#### 5. Load all transport jets
#### 6. Engage in combat!
#### 7. Add a jet to the fleet
#### 8. Remove a jet from the fleet
#### 9. Quit

## Lessons Learned
### I learned that developing software architecture is a complicated task. I researched the topic beforehand to understand as much as I could about the subject I was modeling. I had hoped that knowing more about it would enable more effective and purpose-driven abstraction. I believe this did help, although one facet of the assistance this exercise provided was the realization that I do not quite understand the proper use of interfaces.

## Technologies Used
### For research, I used google.com and baidu.com, searching in both English and Mandarin Chinese.
### I created the program using Java.
### I implemented version control using the git command line interface.
### Having originally intended to first create a UML and potentially use that UML to generate code, I downloaded Papyrus. However, I ran into technical difficulties over the weekend and didn't have nearly as much time as I would have liked. Since creating a UML diagram was not a requisite component of the project, I elected to wait until later to learn Papyrus and practice my hand.
